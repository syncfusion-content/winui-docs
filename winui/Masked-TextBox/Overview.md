# WinUI MaskedTextBox Overview

The [WinUI MaskedTextBox](https://www.syncfusion.com/winui-controls/masked-textbox) is an advanced version of the input control that restricts input of certain characters, text, and numbers by using a mask pattern. This control is used to create a template for providing information such as telephone numbers, email IDs, IP addresses, product keys, and so on.
