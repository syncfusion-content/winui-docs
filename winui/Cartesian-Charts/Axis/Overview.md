# Axis in WinUI Chart (SfCartesianChart)

[ChartAxis](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartAxis.html) is used to locate a data point within the chart area. Charts typically have two axes that are used to measure and categorize data: a vertical (Y) axis and a horizontal (X) axis.

The vertical (Y) axis always uses a numerical scale. The horizontal (X) axis supports the following types of scales:

* Category
* Numeric
* DateTime

## Key Features

* The axis supports different types, such as Category, Numeric, and DateTime.
* It allows you to customize the chart axis line, including gridlines and tick lines. It also supports customizing the style of the axis line by defining the [AxisLineStyle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartAxis.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartAxis_AxisLineStyle).
* You can customize the origin of the chart axis.
* Options are provided to set padding for the axis and the visible range of the axis.
* Multiple axes support allows for arranging multiple series within the same chart area, providing more space for the X and Y axes.
