# Axis in WinUI Chart (SfCartesianChart)

[ChartAxis](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartAxis.html) is used to locate a data point inside the chart area. Charts typically have two axes that are used to measure and categorize data: a vertical (Y) axis, and a horizontal (X) axis.

The vertical (Y) axis always uses a numerical scale, while the horizontal (X) axis supports various types of scales:

* Category
* Numeric
* Date time

## Key features

* Axis supports different types of axis such as Category, Numeric, and Date-time.
* Allow you to customize the chart axis line such as gridlines, tick lines, and support to customize the style of the axis line by defining the [AxisLineStyle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartAxis.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartAxis_AxisLineStyle). 
* Axis allow you to customize the origin of the chart axis. 
* The options provided allow you to set the padding for the axis and define the visible range of the axis.
* The support for multiple axes allows you to arrange multiple series within the same chart area, providing more space for the X and Y axes.
