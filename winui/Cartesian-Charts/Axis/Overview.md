# Axis in WinUI Chart (SfCartesianChart)

[ChartAxis](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartAxis.html) is used to locate a data point inside the chart area. Charts typically have two axes that are used to measure and categorize data: a vertical (Y) axis, and a horizontal (X) axis.

Vertical(Y) axis always uses numerical scale. Horizontal(X) axis supports the following types of scale:

* Category
* Numeric
* Date time

## Key features

* Axis supports different type of axis such as Category, Numeric and Date time.
* Allow you to customize the chart axis line such as gridlines, tick lines, and support to customize the style of the axis line by defining the [AxisLineStyle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartAxis.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartAxis_AxisLineStyle). 
* Axis allow you to customize the origin of the chart axis. 
* Provides options to set padding for axis and axis visible range.
* Multiple axes support provides a way to arrange multiple series inside the same chart area, gives more space for X and Y axis.
