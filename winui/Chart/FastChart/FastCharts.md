# Fast Chart in WinUI Chart

`Chart` includes functionality for rendering large data points with fast plotting, and it has more than five [fast chart types](https://www.syncfusion.com/winui-controls/charts/fast-charts). Each chart type is easily configurable with built-in support for creating high-performance charts.

* FastLine Series - Segments of the series are rendered using a polyline segment.
* Fast Bitmap Series - Segments of the series are rendered using WriteableBitmap.
