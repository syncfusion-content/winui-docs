# Fast Series in WinUI Chart

## FastLine Chart

The [`FastLineSeries`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.FastLineSeries.html) is a special kind of line series that can render a collection with a huge number of data points using the polyline segment. 

{% tabs %}

{% highlight xaml %}

<chart:FastLineSeries ItemsSource="{Binding Data}"

XBindingPath="XValue" YBindingPath="YValue"/>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# %}

FastLineSeries series = new FastLineSeries()
{

    ItemsSource = new ViewModel().Data,

    XBindingPath = "XValue",

    YBindingPath = "YValue",

};

chart.Series.Add(series);

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
