# Appointment Editing in WinUI Scheduler (SfScheduler)

This section explains how to handle appointment editing in WinUI scheduler and also explains about the appointment resizing.

## Creating appointments

The Scheduler supports adding new appointment by using [Appointment Editor](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.SchedulerAppointmentEditorView.html) UI dialog. Open this editor dialog by double-clicking on a time cell.

## Editing appointment

The Scheduler supports editing the existing appointments by using the [Appointment Editor](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.SchedulerAppointmentEditorView.html) UI dialog. Open this dialog by double-clicking on the appointment.

![edit-an-appointment-using-appointment-editor-dialog-in-winui-scheduler](Appointment-Editing_Images/edit-an-appointment-using-appointment-editor-dialog-in-winui-scheduler.png)

The appointments in the appointment editor dialog can be edited. These changes will be saved back in the appointment and mapped data object when using data binding.

### Edit recurring appointment

The Scheduler supports editing the recurrence appointment. The following editor dialog will appear while editing the recurrence appointment to select whether to edit only the particular occurrence or recurrence series.

![edit-an-recurring-appointment-using-recurring-appointment-editor-dialog-in-winui-scheduler](Appointment-Editing_Images/edit-an-recurring-appointment-using-recurring-appointment-editor-dialog-in-winui-scheduler.png)

The opening of recurrence popup editor dialog can be handled using [RecurringAppointmentEditMode](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.RecurringAppointmentEditMode.html) property in [AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs.html) by handling [AppointmentEditorOpening](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.SfScheduler.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_SfScheduler_AppointmentEditorOpening) event.

### AppointmentEditorOpening event

While opening the appointment editor UI dialog to add or update appointment, the Scheduler notifies the [AppointmentEditorOpening](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.SfScheduler.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_SfScheduler_AppointmentEditorOpening) event.

The [AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs.html) has following members which provides the information for the [AppointmentEditorOpening](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.SfScheduler.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_SfScheduler_AppointmentEditorOpening) event.

[Appointment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs_Appointment): Gets the selected appointment details which are being updated. It will be null when adding a new appointment using the appointment editor.

For example, to use a custom appointment editor dialog instead of a default appointment editor content dialog, you can handle the `AppointmentEditorOpening` event.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
this.Schedule.AppointmentEditorOpening += Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpening;

private void Schedule_AppointmentEditorOpening(object sender, AppointmentEditorOpeningEventArgs e)
{
    //To handle the default appointment editor content dialog by setting the e.Cancel value to true.
    e.Cancel = true;

    if (e.Appointment != null)
    {
        //Display the custom appointment editor content dialog to edit the appointment.
    }
    else
    {
        //Display the custom appointment editor content dialog to add new appointment.
    }
}

The following code shows how to collapse the [Recurrence](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.AppointmentEditorOptions.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Scheduler_AppointmentEditorOptions_Recurrence) editor by handling the [AppointmentEditorOptions](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Scheduler.AppointmentEditorOptions.html) event.
